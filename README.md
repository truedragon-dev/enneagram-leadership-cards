# Enneagram Leadership Cards

Interactive flipable cards for team development that combine individual awareness with collective intelligence.

## What This Tool Does

- **Front side**: Individual Enneagram patterns (Core Drive, Shadow Watch, Growth Edge, etc.)
- **Back side**: Questions for Higher Team IQ that leverage each type's perceptual gifts
- **Weekly Team Experiments**: Practice growth edges collectively as a team

## How to Use

1. **Individual Awareness**: Read your type's patterns on the front of cards
2. **Team Intelligence**: Flip cards to access field-reading questions during meetings
3. **Team Experiments**: Use the final card to practice growth edges together weekly

## For Teams That

- Want to move beyond just "understanding differences" 
- Learn through doing, then reflecting
- Are ready for developmental challenge, not just accommodation
- Use practices like "balcony/dance floor" for systems thinking
